         <h3>About Me</h3>
         <section>
        <p>I'm a Web Developer from central New Hampshire. Before I got into creating websites and applications, I was a
          professional snowboarder. I started competing around the East Coast of the US and eventually started to compete in
          international competitions as well as starring in snowboard films.</p>
        <p>
          Computers have always been a passion of mine which led me to becoming a web developer. Some people seem to link
          creativty with art, music, dance, etc. For myself, with programming I can show my creativity by building something
          that
          has the possibility to be used by other people and I think that is pretty awesome.
